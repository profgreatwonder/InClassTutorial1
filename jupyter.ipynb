Because much of the tutorial regarding the notebook is not well suited to static presentation on web pages, it is recommended that you watch the video lecture and follow along in the notebook, rather than solely rely on these notes.  In addition, unlike the majority of the notes for this class (which are written in Jupyter Notebook, but then exported to Markdown for presentation on the class website), I am going to leave these notes in Jupyter notebook form, to emphasize the fact that you can download and step through the examples here.

Jupyter Notebook is an evolution of an older project called the IPython Noteboook (this is the origin of the notebook file extension \".ipynb\"), and while (as the name suggests) Jupyter Notebook supports languages other than Python, at the current time Python is by far the most common language for these notebook.  General information about Jupyter Notebook and related projects can be found at the [Jupyter project page](http://jupyter.org).\n",

All Python code is executed in a single running Python environment, called the \"Kernel\" in Jupyter notebook.  Variables are shared across all cells, and the code is executed in the order in which the cells are run (not necessarily sequential in the notebook), which can get your notebook into rather confusing states if you don't always execute cells in order.\n",

    "\n",
    "Because you'll be spending a lot of timing writing code in the notebook, it helps to become at least a little bit familiar with the features of the editor.  While the notebook in many ways makes a poor actual code editing environment (compared to more fully featured editors ranging from Sublime, vi, Emacs, Atom, etc), it's not that bad if you familiarize yourself with some of the keyboard shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can look up all the keyboard shortcuts (in addition to adding your own) in the \"Help -> Keyboard Shortcuts\" menu, but some of the more common ones I use are the following.  First, though, it is important to distinguish between the \"edit mode\" (when directly editing a cell) and \"command mode\" (navigating over cells).  You can switch between these using \"ESC\" or \"Ctrl-M\" (switch to command mode) and \"Enter\" (switch to edit more).\n",
    "\n",
    "Common keyboard shortcuts in command mode:\n",
    "- \"x\": delete a cell (though be careful, because you can only undo the deletion of one cell)\n",
    "- \"a\": insert new cell above\n",
    "- \"b\": insert new cell below\n",
    "- \"m\": convert cell to Markdown\n",
    "- \"y\": convert cell to code\n",
    "- Up/down: navigate up and down over cells\n",
    "- Shift-Enter, Ctrl-Enter: execute cell (also works in edit mode)\n",
    "\n",
    "Common shortcuts in edit mode:\n",
    "- Ctrl-up/Ctrl-down: move to start/end of cell\n",
    "- Tab: indent selected area (when text is selected) or autocomplete (when editing in the middle of a line)\n",
    "- Shift-Tab: unindent selected area (when text is selected), get function help (when following a function name)\n",
    "- Command-/: toggle comment/uncommand selected region\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to familiarize yourself with these commands is to try to use the notebook entirely without using the mouse.  In practice, you'll often rely on the mouse for some things (for instance, I prefer to have commands like restarting the kernel require a mouse click), but trying to avoid it for some time will get you familiar enough with the common commands to be fairly productive in the Notebook editing environment."

After writing some portion of code, you can press the \"tab\" key to autocomplete: if there is only one viable completion of the word you are currently typing, it will simply complete the word.  If there are multiple viable predictions, then it will open a popup menu where you can view all possible completions.  The later is useful for quickly browsing through all functions or variables in a library/object.\n",

We won't cover very many of these, but some are very useful and so you should be familiar with the basics.

    "### List implmentation internals\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note about lists, it is important for creating efficient Python code to understand a little bit about the nature of how lists are implemented internally.  Python lists are not really \"lists\" in the typical CS sense of the word, i.e., they are not linked lists or some structure like this.  Instead, a Python list is really a _dynamically sized array_.  That is, a list is an array of fixed-size elements (more precisely, it is an array of abstract \"Python Object\" elements, which in turn point to numbers, strings, other arrays, etc, while having the actual array elements in the list be fixed size).  The arrays are pre-allocated to have a certain amount of \"extra elements\" that can be used to add new items to the list; if we want to append a new item to the list, and do not have enough room in the underlying array, it is resized with some additional buffer (for example, the underlying size could be doubled ... though in reality Python uses a slightly more involved growth algorithm than just doubling each time) to allow for the additional elements.  Because this resizing happens relatively infrequently, it does not cost much from a computational perspective.  Put in big O notation, the following operations are lists are all constant time:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Append: O(1) (average case)\n",
    "- Lookup: O(1)\n",
    "- Delete last element: O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if you attempt to insert a new element somewhere in the middle of the list (shifting down later element), or delete an item in the middle of the list (shifting up later elements), these operations are expensive, because we need to copy every single item in the list after the inserted or deleted item, and move it in memory.  In big O notation, the following operations take linear time:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Insert element at arbitrary position: O(n)\n",
    "- Delete element at arbitrary position: O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "As an illustration of this, let's consider two versions of code that creates an array, either by appending or inserting (at the beginning of the list) new elements:"

    "### Dictionary internals\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, dictionaries are represented using _hash tables_.  That is, the dictionary elements are all contained in a relatively small array.  When inserting a new element in the dictionary, we compute a _hash_ of the key, and modulo this number by the size of the array.  If that location in the underlying array is empty, we store the key/value pair at that index.  The the location is already with note _different_ element (which has to be possible, since there are more possible keys than the size of the underlying array) we execute what is called a \"probing strategy\" to find the next free slot.  The details of the hashing function and probing strategy aren't important (some info is on the page linked below), but the key portions are that the process is deterministic, so we can easily both assign elements and look up elements by key (similarly computing the hash and probing until the key at the location matches the key we are looking for ... note that this is why we need to store both the key _and_ value in the array).\n",
    "\n",
    "A good hash function will tend to generate \"random\" locations in the array, so there is a high probably we will find an empty slot without too many probing iterations.  In Python, once the array is 2/3 full, we double (or quadruple, for small-sized dictionaries) the size of the underlying array, and rebuild the hash table (which is required, since the location of different key/values pairs now changes for a different size of underlying array).  Just like with a list, although this rebuilding operation is slow, because it happens relatively infrequently, it does not end up costing too much time.  In big O notation, the operations of a dictionary all have (average case) constant time:\n",

Class methods and static methods (see the discussion in the list below) behave differently, but we won't be using those features much in this class.  The second thing of some importance is that unlike other object-oriented languages, Python does not actually have a distinction between \"public\" and \"private\" variables.  Although here it seems like the \"n\" variable should be private (inaccessible outside the class), and only accessible via the method `get_n()`, we can just as easily access it directly."
